# headway_test

Hello! It's my realization of headway backend engineer assessment.<br/>

In order to use the cli you need to create a `.env` file inside headway_test folder and add a `API_KEY` variable there. 
Then just run 
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
The command above will start a container with cli inside. <br/><br/>
To run the cli you need to run

```bash
docker exec headway_test-app-1 nasa
```
